For this project, I chose the renowned product sales dataset, a classic in the realm of machine learning, which comprises sale of different products and comparison of the total price through it's unit price and quantity. Here's a glimpse into what I accomplished:

Data Cleaning:
I meticulously checked for missing values and duplicates, ensuring the integrity and quality of the dataset.
Employing best practices in data cleaning, I prepared the dataset for analysis, laying a solid foundation for exploration.

üîç Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Leveraging powerful visualization tools, I embarked on an insightful journey to explore relationships between variables.
Through captivating visualizations such as pair plots, correlation heatmaps, and box plots, I unraveled fascinating patterns and trends hidden within the data.
I delved deep into the distributions of features, gaining a comprehensive understanding of the Product consumerism dataset's characteristics and nuances.

üìà Insights and Learnings:
The EDA process illuminated intriguing relationships between variables, shedding light on the distinctive characteristics of different iris species.
By meticulously analyzing patterns and trends, I honed my skills in deriving actionable insights from data, a crucial aspect of data science.
This internship has been an incredible learning experience, allowing me to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world datasets and develop invaluable skills in data analysis and visualization.
